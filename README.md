# Asset Insights - Andriod Developer Coding Test

## Prerequisites

You will need:
    - Andriod studio / IntelliJ

## Task

1) Create a new blank project with an an Empty Activity template in Andriod Studio (Just use the latest Andriod version installed on your machine)
2) Create a API request that pulls back a cat fact from this open source API https://catfact.ninja/fact (if you go to https://catfact.ninja in your browser you should be able to see the schema)
3) Create a view which displays the fact
4) Add a button to your view which will get a new fact each time and display it in the view

**BONUS:** If time allows pre cache your cat fact on each button click. For example - You cat fact should come from the cache and in the background get a new cat fact for the next time it is clicked.

## Bits of Advice
 - Take your time and feel free to ask questions at any point
 - When displaying your cat fact and button there is no need to focus on the look and feel.  We would like you to spend most of your time on the functionality and ensuring that code is clean and working as it should. 

 Good Luck!
